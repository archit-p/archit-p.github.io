Its simple, easy to use and best of all blazingly fast. In order to create a build system around Go's compiler that can account for varied project structures, I like to use a <code>Makefile</code> for building, testing and documenting my Go projects.</p>\n<h2>Simple Makefile Structure</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-makefile\">GO=go\nSOURCE=cmd/main.go\nTARGET=main\nDOCS=docs/docs_init.go\nSWAG=swag\nINSTALLPATH=${GOBIN}\n\n.PHONY: help docs clean test dep install\n\nhelp:\n    @echo \"use \\`make &#x3C;target> where &#x3C;target> is:\\'\"\n    @echo \" help: display this help\"\n    @echo \" dep: download dependencies\"\n    @echo \" docs: build swagger documentation\"\n    @echo \" build: generate executable\"\n    @echo \" test: run tests\"\n    @echo \" install: build, test and install (to ${GOBIN} by default)\"\n    @echo \" clean: clean the build directory\"\n\ndep:\n    ${GO} get \\\n        github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag \\\n        github.com/swaggo/http-swagger\n\ndocs: dep\n    ${SWAG} init -g ${DOCS}\n\nbuild: dep\n    ${GO} build -o ${TARGET} ${SOURCE}\n\ntest: dep\n    ${GO} test ./... -v\n\ninstall: build test\n    cp ${TARGET} ${INSTALLPATH}\n\nclean:\n    rm -f ${TARGET} 1>/dev/null 2>&#x26;1\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Advantages with Makefiles</h2>\n<h3>Uniformity Across Various Projects</h3>\n<p>When working on a new project or revisiting an old one, I don't need to scour for the build target or download dependencies manually.</p>\n<h3>Most Developers Already have GNUMake Setup</h3>\n<p>This is very helpful when collaborating. Since most developers are already familiar with GNUMake and the <code>make</code> command, they can get started faster.</p>\n<h3>Customizable</h3>\n<p>Makefiles are very customizable. This holds true here as well. I can easily edit them to use a specific version of Go, tweak target names or change the install location.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/blog/makefiles-for-go-projects","title":"Makefiles for Go Projects","date":"September 12th 2020"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
